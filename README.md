# Features

(1) Type text and hit the Enter

(2) Note is added and saved in the Cloud (CRUD API)

(3) Whenever required, delete, edit or copy it from the text field down below

Note: If browser is refreshed, the notes disappears but upon clicking the "Load existing note(s)", the App fetches with {crud:api} to retrieve the saved note(s).
